                            <h2>Why Ford is the best</h2>
                                <p>Introduced in 1948, the Ford F-150 owns the distinction of being the most popular motor vehicle of all time. For well over 30 years, the F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States. Further, for more than 40 years, it has been the best selling pickup truck. Clearly Ford is on to something here. Currently in its 13th generation, the contemporary edition of the highly regarded Ford is the first pickup truck to rely heavily upon aluminum construction, which has reduced its curb weight by some 700 pounds. Over the years, there have been many different variants—high performance iterations, off-road-oriented models, luxurious examples, and, of course, plain-Jane work versions. Beneath them all, however, the honesty of the F-150’s robust nature always shines through. There’s no question about it, when all is said and done, regardless of the veneer with which Ford’s product planners have chosen to adorn the F-150, at its essence the Ford is simply a very tough pickup truck. Is there any wonder the Ford F-150 is the best selling vehicle in America?</p>
